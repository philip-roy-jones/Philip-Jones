        <p>
            Hello! My name is Philip Jones. I am 22 years old male, from Rockland County, New York.
            I graduated from the University at Buffalo with a degree in Business Administration, and will be attending Oregon State University's post-baccalaureate Computer Science program.
            My goal is to create meaningful art, and to inspire dreamers that it can be done.
        </p>

            Art is everywhere. From a city skyline to Mike Tyson's left hook, you probably feel some type of emotion about these things.
